#### By _**Ryan McLean**_

## Description

_This is a clone of the famous Facebook. By the time I am done you will be able to log in and user a few features that facebook currently offers. At the moment you can create a account and log in with the first name and password that you set._

## Research

* _Study of https://www.facebook.com_
* _Understanding where all the different components are ex. (header, recent logins, create a account, etc)_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You can get these files by going into your terminal or powershell and type in `git clone https://github.com/Lilkgb/javawk3`_
* _Once downloaded in terminal or powershell direct yourself to `javawk3` folder_
* _Run `npm install` to get all needed dependencies_
* _You may run `npm start` of `ng serve --open` to bring up a live version of the website through your local host_
* _I use karma-jasime to test my functions so if you would like you use it as well run `npm test` on a mac. I haven't figured out how to make jasmine work on pc_
* _Create a repository for yourself on github or whatever you may use_
* _Copy url link thats given and run `git remote add -Your initials- -Link-`_
* _Push your project when ready with `git push -Your initials- -Branch name (master is default)-`_

## Development server

_Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files._

## Code scaffolding

_Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`._

## Build

_Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build._

## Running unit tests

_Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)._

## Running end-to-end tests

_Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/)._
